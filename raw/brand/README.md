# raw/brand/

Your brand's own words: what you publish, what sounds right, what sounds wrong, and any guides you already have. Exercises 2 and 3 read this folder. Exercise 1 does not.

`/ingest` leaves the files in this folder alone: they are module inputs, not inbox items. Drop something in the top of `raw/` instead, and `/ingest` will offer to move it here.

## What goes where

| Path | What to add | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `urls.md` | 5 to 8 URLs, one per line: your homepage, 3 to 5 blog posts, 2 to 3 social posts | Exercises 2 and 3 |
| `scraped/` | Nothing. The exercises save scraped pages here so they are not fetched twice | Exercises 2 and 3 |
| `on-brand/` | Copy that sounds exactly right: your best emails, ads, landing page sections, posts | Exercise 3 |
| `off-brand/` | Near misses: old copy, AI drafts that felt wrong, competitor lines you would never write. URLs of pages like that go in `off-brand/urls.md` | Exercise 3 |
| `guides/` | Brand, style, or messaging docs you already have, if they are safe to share. Internal or confidential ones go in `raw/strategy/` | Exercises 2 and 3 |

Paste text into Markdown files. Label every sample with where it came from and when.

## What never goes here

This folder is committed to git. **No client material, nothing under NDA, nothing confidential.** If you work at an agency, use your own agency's brand, or the Acme Deals example.

## Example

`example/` is a complete brand set for Acme Deals, the fictional brand from the voice-of-customer example: a voice guide, on-brand ads, and off-brand ads generated for the demo. Use it to practise exercises 2 and 3, or to see what good inputs look like.
